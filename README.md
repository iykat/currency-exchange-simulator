# Currency-Exchange-Simulator ðŸ’±ðŸ’¹
A crypto trading platform simulator written in C++ to develop object oriented programming and data handling skills.

After building this program, I have developed various C++ programming skills. Some of the things I learned include how to:

- Use control flow to build interactive, multi-branched, iterated programs

- Select appropriate data types to model the trading platform's information

- Convert algorithms from pseudo-code to C++ and test them

- Use classes to combine data and functions and to model interactions between different parts of a program

- To construct an extensive program from multiple modules
